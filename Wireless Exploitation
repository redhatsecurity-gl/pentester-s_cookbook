Chapter 10. Wireless Exploitation

In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:

Setting up a wireless network
Bypassing MAC address filtering
Sniffing network traffic
Cracking WEP encryption
Cracking WPA/WPA2 encryption
Cracking WPS
Denial-of-service attacks

Wi-Fi interface modes
Master: Access point or base station
Managed: Infrastructure mode (client)
Ad-Hoc: Device to device
Mesh: (Mesh cloud/network)
Repeater: Range extender
Monitor: RFMON=
Wi-Fi frames
Management frames:
Beacon frame: The access point periodically sends a beacon frame to announce its presence and relay information, such as a timestamp, SSID, and other parameters regarding the access point to radio NICs that are within range. Radio NICs continually scan all 802.11 radio channels and listen to beacons as the basis for choosing which access point is best to associate with.
Probe: Two types: Probe request and Probe response:
Probe request frame: A station sends a probe request frame when it needs to obtain information from another station. For example, a radio NIC would send a probe request to determine which access points are within range.
Probe response frame: A station will respond with a probe response frame, containing capability information, supported data rates, and so on after it receives a probe request frame.
